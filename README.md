# 🧠 LLM Training Copilot

> **A pre-flight check tool that predicts if your ML training will succeed BEFORE you waste hours on a failed run.**

Built with **Gemini 3** for the Google AI Hackathon.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Training LLMs often fails due to:
- **OOM crashes** — Out of memory errors 2 hours into training
- **Overfitting** — Model memorizes instead of learning
- **Wrong hyperparameters** — Training never converges
- **Time miscalculations** — "Quick run" takes 3 days

You only discover these **after** training starts. This tool tells you **before**.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🔬 **Multi-AI Analysis** | 3 specialist Gemini 3 agents: Hardware Analyst, Training Analyst, Chief Analyst |
| 📊 **Pre-flight Predictions** | Memory usage, failure modes, training time, overfitting risk |
| ❓ **Explain Buttons** | Click ❓ on any section for detailed explanation |
| 💬 **Smart Chat** | Ask configuration questions — AI answers with calculations |
| 📜 **History & Compare** | Save configs, compare side-by-side |
| 🔑 **Demo Mode** | Works without API key for judges to test |

## 🧠 How Multi-AI Reasoning Works

```
User Config → [Hardware Analyst] → Memory calculations
           → [Training Analyst] → Hyperparameter analysis
                     ↓
              [Chief Analyst] → Synthesized verdict
                     ↓
           ✅ Safe / ⚠️ Risky / ❌ Will Fail
```

Each specialist focuses on its domain. The Chief Analyst combines their reasoning into actionable advice.
